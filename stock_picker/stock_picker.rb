=begin
-------brainstorming-----

- buy first, sell second number
- do opposite of what I said before

    sell value - buy value

    - sell value can NOT be stock[0]
    - buy value can NOT be the stock[-1]

- needs to go through all of the stock price options

- need logic to find which pair has the highest profit? compare profits

- try to be more effient with the code this time!
